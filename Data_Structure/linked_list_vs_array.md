A linked list generally requires more memory than an array to store the same number of elements due to several factors:

### Overhead
Overhead refers to the additional resources required to manage or support a system or process. Overhead includes
- any extra memory,
- processing time, or
- other resources needed to manage these structures effectively.

### 1. Node Overhead
Each element in a linked list is stored in a node, which typically contains:
- The actual data.
- A pointer/reference to the next node (and in the case of a doubly linked list, an additional pointer/reference to the previous node).

In contrast, an array only needs to store the data itself. Therefore, each element in a linked list has an additional memory overhead for the pointer/reference.

### 2. Memory Allocation Overhead
Dynamic memory allocation, which is commonly used for linked lists, often involves some additional overhead to manage the allocated blocks of memory. This overhead is generally not present in statically allocated arrays, which are allocated as a single contiguous block of memory.

### Detailed Breakdown

#### Linked List Node Structure
In a singly linked list:
```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int data;
    Node* next;
};
```
Each node typically requires:
- `sizeof(int)` bytes for the data.
- `sizeof(Node*)` bytes for the pointer to the next node.

Assuming `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes and `sizeof(Node*) = 8` bytes (on a 64-bit system), each node requires:
- 4 bytes for the data.
- 8 bytes for the pointer.
- Total: 12 bytes per node.

#### Array Structure
For an array of `n` integers:
```cpp
int arr[n];
```
Each element requires `sizeof(int)` bytes, and there are no additional pointers:
- 4 bytes per element (assuming `sizeof(int) = 4` bytes).
- Total: 4 bytes per element.

### Example Calculation
For `n` elements:
- **Linked List**: Each node requires 12 bytes, so total memory required is `12 * n` bytes.
- **Array**: Each element requires 4 bytes, so total memory required is `4 * n` bytes.

### Summary
The linked list requires more memory due to:
1. **Pointer Storage**: Each node contains an extra pointer/reference, adding to the memory footprint.
2. **Allocation Overhead**: Dynamic memory allocation for each node can add additional overhead, depending on the memory allocator's implementation.

Therefore, for the same number of elements, a linked list generally consumes more memory compared to an array.
